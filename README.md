# TestScandiWeb
I did my best with the current knowledge from the academy. Had some issues. A component of mine did not want to render for some reason. Did my best to fix it
Note: Also some other projects of mine will be listed for you to check out. And the .json file needs to be start in another terminal with : npx json-server --watch -p 3333 dbscandi.json
Hope i will hear feedback from you.
